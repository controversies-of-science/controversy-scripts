_"In astronomy, the term proper motion refers to the angular velocity across the sky exhibited by a celestial body. The enormous distances to the stars means that only the closest have proper motions that are large enough to be expressed in arcseconds per year – milliarcseconds per year are more common. Because of these small angular velocities, it is necessary to use a telescope that has a high angular resolution to measure proper motions."_

_"Stars with large proper motions tend to be nearby; most stars are far enough away that their proper motions are very small, on the order of a few thousandths of an arcsecond per year. It is possible to construct nearly complete samples of high proper motion stars by comparing photographic sky survey images taken many years apart. The Palomar Sky Survey is one source of such images. In the past, searches for high proper motion objects were undertaken using blink comparators to examine the images by eye, but modern efforts use techniques such as image differencing to automatically search through digitized image data."_
